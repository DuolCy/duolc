Though we are told that alcohol is dangerous, especially driving a car after drinking alcohol,we can see the news about car accidents because of the driver drinking alcohol everyday, still people ignore the danger of drinking alcohol. Life is precious, no one will take responsibility of our lives except ourselves. Drinking too much will do harm to our body, even if you don’t cherish your life, while when you drive the car after drinking, you will take away other people’s lives. That is unforgivable, people have a happy family, they die because of your careless driving, and you will never have a chance to make up. Our government is very strict to the driver, the law clearly claims that drinking driver will be heavily punished. In order to make sure other people’s safety, we should not drive the car after drinking alcohol, or we ask friends to take us home.
